# Timetest
R/timetest.R tests for different runtimes in various parallel coordinates
data sets

## Data
* Load times
* Large data sets (MSD)
* Medium data sets
* Small data sets
* Discrete

## Packages 
* freqparcoord.cd
* freqparcoord
* ggparallel
* ggparcoord (Unavailable for 3.4)
* lattice
* rggobi (Unavailable due to RGtk2)
* parcoord (MASS) (Unavailable for 3.4)

## Notes
It seems running with Rscript does not open plotly windows. However, the 
timings should still be accurate.
